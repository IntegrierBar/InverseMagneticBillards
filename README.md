# InverseMagneticBillards
Requires Godot game engine version 3.5 (we used 3.5.2)


# How to compile
The code is split into 2 parts.
The code inside the GDNative fodler is the C++ code for the calculations. Compilation is only required if you do not compile for windows or web
The code inside the Godot folder is the Godot project itself.

## Requirements
Godot version 3.5.2 Standard (https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.5.2-stable/)

If you need to compile the GDNative part as well, a C++ compiler and CMake is required
